# Chat Room Package

This package contains the code for the chat room

The server can be found in `server.py`

`client_multithread.py` is a standalone client that can send and receive messages by typing into the terminal.

We based `Client.py` off of `client_multithread.py` to create a class for the client so we could call the send and receive functions of the client when needed
