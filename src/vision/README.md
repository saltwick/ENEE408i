# Vision Package

This package contains the vision/localization system.

Most of the code was used for testing and is therefore undocumented. Important files are `locator.py` and `Tracker.py`

`makeWorld.py` can be used to generate a JSON file containing April Tag ID to world point associations

`calibration.py` can be used with images of a checkerboard to obtain camera calibration parameters
