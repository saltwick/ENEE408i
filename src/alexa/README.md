# Alexa Package

This package contains some relevant code for coding Alexa

`BigAl.py` contains examples of Alexa skill intents and how to send a message through a chat server through Alexa.

Note that this is not the final code for the Alexa. If you'd like to see that look at the Flask_Thread class in `Threads.py` under /src/controller.
