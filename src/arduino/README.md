# Arduino Code
nav is the main code that the arduino runs.

Within /nav are header and C files for the motor and ultrasound along with the arduino nav.ino file that includes all the header and .c files. The arduino pin information is defined in the header files

There is also some basic test files to run on the arduino when the sensors and such were being set up
